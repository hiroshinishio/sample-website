## What is the feature

The feature is to create a simple landing page similar to Figma using Next.js.

## Why we need the feature

We need this feature to provide a modern, visually appealing, and user-friendly landing page that can attract and retain users.

## How to implement and why

1. **Set up a new Next.js project**: This will provide the foundation for our landing page.
   - Use `npx create-next-app` to initialize the project.
   
2. **Create the main landing page component**: This will be the main entry point for users.
   - Create a new file `pages/index.js`.
   - Implement a functional component that returns the basic structure of the landing page.

3. **Add a header section**: This will include the logo and navigation links.
   - Create a `components/Header.js` file.
   - Use CSS modules or styled-components for styling.

4. **Design the hero section**: This will be the main attraction of the landing page.
   - Add a hero section in `pages/index.js` with a catchy headline, subheadline, and a call-to-action button.
   - Use CSS for styling to make it visually appealing.

5. **Include feature sections**: Highlight the key features of the product.
   - Create reusable components for feature sections.
   - Add these components to `pages/index.js`.

6. **Add a footer**: This will contain additional links and information.
   - Create a `components/Footer.js` file.
   - Style it to match the overall design of the landing page.

7. **Optimize for responsiveness**: Ensure the landing page looks good on all devices.
   - Use media queries in CSS.
   - Test on different screen sizes.

8. **Deploy the application**: Make the landing page accessible to users.
   - Use Vercel for easy deployment of the Next.js application.
